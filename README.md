# Demographic Data Analyzer

This is a project for FreeCodeCamp.org certificate in Data Analysis w/ Python. 

In this challenge I must analyze demographic data using Pandas. There is a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

Using Pandas, I answered the following questions:

- How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)
- What is the average age of men?
- What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
- What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
- What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
- What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
- What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
- What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
- Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

For development, you can use main.py to test the functions. Click the "run" button and main.py will run.

Unit tests are written under test_module.py. It's imported from test_module.py to main.py for your convenience. The tests will run automatically whenever you hit the "run" button.
